  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p> Hi there! My name is <strong> Lisa Gahart </strong> and I am a student at San Jose State. There are many things that I care about as an artist but what matters most to me is being able to express
    my creativity in an open way. Subjects that I explore in my work are of <em> everday life and nature. </em> Being able to capture the world around me
    and activities in my personal life help to inspire my artwork and subjects. 
    
    <p> The approaches that I take in my work that reflect my interest are, taking experiences of my daily life and trying to protray a strong message from 
      them. I present an unflitered and aesthetic version of my life and personal interest to help to entertain the viewer and to be gentle on the eyes. Music is also a large
      part of my everyday life and that is reflected in most all of my works of art. Music is presented in the form of either an actual song in the background or the music 
      of birds, wind, traffic, nature. As important as the aesthetic and concepts of my works are, the sound is just as big a part of the piece
      and experience as anything else.
