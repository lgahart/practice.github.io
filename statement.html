  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p> <strong> Hi! My name is Lisa Gahart </strong>, there are many things that I care about as an artist but what matters most to me is being able to express
    my creativity in an open way. Subjects that I explore in my work are of <em> everday life and nature. </em> Being able to capture the world around me
    and activities in my personal life help to inspire my artwork and subjects. Nature is always surrounding us as artist and it is important to 
    capture it in a way that can inspire the audience of that piece. 
    
    <p> The approaches that I take in my work that reflect my interest are, taking pieces of my daily life and reflecting them in my work. I present
      a more unflitered and asthetic version of my life and personal interest to help to entertain the viewer and to be gentle on the eyes. Music is also a large
      part of my everyday life and that is reflected in most all of my works of art. Music is presented in the form of either an actual song in the background or the music 
      of birds, wind, traffic, nature. As important as the asthetics and concepts of my works are, the sound is just as big a part of the piece
      and experience as anything else.
