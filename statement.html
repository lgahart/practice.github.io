  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My name is Lisa Gahart, the projects on this page are made for a video class that I am taking this semester <em> Art 75 </em>. My projects are meant for mainly learning purposes
  as well as to broaden my skills as an artist and design student. My first few videos are for warm up purposes as the five shot video shows simple video transitions of concert footage
  that I put together. My project one is meant to mimic the rising popularity of vlogs in the youtube community as I filmed a trip to the city with my roommates. Future projects await!</p>
