      <h3>"Project One" Digital Video, 3 min, 2019</h3>
        <p>This first project is of a day spent in San Fransisco with my roommates exploring the city.

         <h3>"Project Two" Digital Video,  2:11 mins, 2019</h3>
        <p> This project was displayed through a video projection mapped on a canvas. This canvas is surrounded by bottles of alcohol and candles to 
          represent a shrine. The message behind this project is to show how we often battle with addictions and finding the peace within.

      <h3>"Final Project" Digital Video,  3:36 mins, 2019</h3>
        <p> This final project is meant to represent the sudden rise of facetune and how destructive it is to girl's body image. Many different youtubers and vlogers
          have touched on this topic and those clips are shown in the beggining of the video. The video ends with a shot of dolls surrounded by makeup
          and other items that girls use to change how they look.
