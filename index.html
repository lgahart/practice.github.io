      <h3>"Project One" Digital Video, 3 min, 2019</h3>
        <p>This is the first project that I did for my Art 75 class. The video is of a day spent in San Fransisco with my roommates exploring the city.
          The concept behind this video is to show the contant video documentation of our lives through instagram/snapchat stories and youtube vlogs.
